# AI House Price Predictor

## Overview
This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project built with Python.
It predicts house prices based on house size and number of bedrooms.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How It Works
1. Loads a dataset from a CSV file
2. Trains a linear regression model
3. Accepts user input for house size and bedrooms
4. Predicts an estimated house price

## Purpose
This project was built as part of my journey into artificial intelligence
and machine learning, with the goal of applying AI to real-world problems
and preparing for global technology programs and international conferences.
